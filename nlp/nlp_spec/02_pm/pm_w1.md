# Natural Language Processing with Probabilistic Models

*Probabilistic Models 概率模型*

## Autocorrect and Minimum Edit Distance

### Overview

Welcome. This week, I will go over autocorrect. It is how your misspelled words are corrected automatically to the right ones. You know it already from your e-mail client on your phone. Let me show you how it works.

- Learning Objectives

  * What is autocorrect

  * Building the model

  * Minimum edit distance

  * Minimum edit diatance algorithm

 So let's go over this week's learning objectives. You'll learn about autocorrect conceptually. You've most likely used it in your phone or word processor. But what is autocorrect exactly? It can mean slightly different things depending on the context. You will learn about the **nuances 细微差别** this week. You'll practice building the model to perform autocorrect. You'll learn each step in autocorrect and key concepts to prepare you for the coding assignments. When performing autocorrect, you will want to be able to *quantify 量化* how far apart or different two strings are, and ask how many letters you can change to go from one string to another. To do this, you will learn to **measure minimum edit distance**. You will implement a really interesting algorithmic approach for solving the minimum edit distance called **dynamic programming**. At the end of the lecture, you'll demonstrate your new skills and put all these techniques to work in this week's assignments.
