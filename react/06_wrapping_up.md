# Wrapping  Up

**Some use cases for Portals beyond just modals.** The one that I like the best, that's probably a much better use case for is like, imagine that you're on one part of your website and *there is a contextual sidebar*, right? Like **a contextual sidebar** and  it's a perfect use case for a portal.

**Can I think of other use cases for context besides CSS up?** Yes.
